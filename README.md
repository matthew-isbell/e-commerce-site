# Baby e-commerce site

This website is a final project I had to make for my web programming class. The idea was to create a website that could help new parents find clothes for their child, or for parents with older kids to have a way to sell old clothes. This idea was implemented because I wanted to try to begin a project that could have a real positive environmental impact if further developed. 

This site was developed with Node, Express, Javascript, JSON (for the data holding), HTML, and CSS. A server is created for the files, where you then go to your local machine and search 'localhost:3004/login'. From here, enter any username and use the password 'myPass' to get in.

Once you are signed in, you can Search for currently active listings, as well as add your own unique listing. Just press the "add new" button in the top right to add one. To look for listings, just go to the search bar and look for what you want. 

In the end, I learned how to make a node server communicate with other javascript files, as well as redirecting data from a server to an html page. I also learned how to add contents to a page dynamically without needing to hard code anything. In the end, this was a very valuable project that taught me alot about web programming.
